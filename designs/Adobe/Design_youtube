Design : 
Example : youtube 
Video uploader : 
	-> Upload content  (constraints) : capacity planning
	-> search based on tags, keywords (data processing)
	-> engagement of a video / user /comments/ likes   (raw data )

Upload Content
	- Video 
	     - Format of video - mp4, mpeg
	    -  Quality - SD/ HD/ UHD - Consider it as Instagram videos 
		- large Size video - 50 MB
		- max size - 50MB 
		- min size - anything
	- 1000 User Per Day will be using it
	- Total number of User
		- 1 Million User active user
	- 20% of 1000 user will upload daily
	- 80% of 1000 will be only viewing
Capacity Planning
	- 1 Million User - allow to store 1000 per user 
Storage
	- 1 Million  * 1000 * 50MB = 1000,000 * 1000 = 1Billion * 50 MB = 50 PBytes = max
	- max / 2 = 25 PB
Data Upload

	- 200 * 25 MB * 24 = 120 GB per hour = ~33 MBps
	
Data Viewing
	- 33 MBps * 4 = 132 MBps
